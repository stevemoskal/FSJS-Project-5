# FSJS-Project-5
### Public API Requests


#### Description

  This repository was designed for the Treehouse TechDegree course, Project-5: Public API Requests

  This project is complete, and I am hoping to obtain an "Exceeds Expectations" grade based on the grading key provided.

  There are three different types of code contained in this repository: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS were provided by Treehouse, and it was my objective to complete the JavaScript code.

  The objective of this website is to use a public API to populate a website with 12 random employees. If any of the random employees is clicked, a modal will be shown containing more information on that employee.

#### Exceeds Expectations Explained

 Search Function -
 A search function has been added, with a search bar in the top-right hand corner. The page will update using the 'input' event listener, on any keyup event, and will reset the page if the 'x' is clicked in the search field.

 Prev/Next Buttons -
 Previous employee and next employee buttons have been added in the modal window, where you can switch between the randomly generated employees.

 Style Changes -
 There are a few subtle style changes made to the program. I have updated the colour scheme, changing the background colour, background color of the employee cards, as well as the border colour of the cards. I have also changed the font, but only on the names displayed on the cards. All changes made in the CSS have been commented.

#### Outside Resources

 I did not have to use many outside resources for this project. Anything that was researched was either done with a google search, or investigated using [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Some aspects of this project also referenced some code used to create [Project-2](https://github.com/stevemoskal/FSJS-Project-2) of the TechDegree.

#### Frameworks Used

 This project was built using:
   - [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io)
   - [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

 Thank you for viewing my repository!
